# State Estimation and Localization, SLAM

## Resources
### Beginner
* [Introduction to Mobile Robotics](http://ais.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/teaching/ss19/robotics/) by Dr. Wolfram Burgard.
##### Note:- The course provided by Dr. Wolfram Burgard is good for understanding the underlying math behind the probabilistic algorithms used in state estimation and localization. The course can be taken as an introduction to the various concepts in the field of mobile robotics. 
* [SLAM-Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6vr3iNrwRA&list=PLgnQpQtFTOGQrZ4O5QzbIHgl3b1JHimN_) by Cyrill Stachniss.
* [State Estimation and Localization for Self-Driving Cars](https://www.coursera.org/learn/state-estimation-localization-self-driving-cars/home/welcome)
##### Note:- This course is specifically crafted for understanding the various methodologies used for localization, sensor fusion, sensor selection, etc. in self-driving cars. It may not cover all the concepts of localization used in robotics, but is targeted for an audience specifically interested in self-driving cars.
