## Roadmap to start Competetive Coding
There is no perfect time to start competitive coding, but if anyone wants to start it, here is a roadmap for you
- Start with learning any programming language like C, C++, Java, Python are some popular programming languages use by all the coders around the globe. Try to start with C then move onto some other programming language if you wish (I prefer C++ after C). Refer to the [Books](#books-to-refer) and [Tutorials](#tutorials) section to start with any language you wish.
- After learning any programming language, the next thing which comes to is practice. You have to practice to write code until you are able to code any problem given to you. There are many online platforms like [HackerEarth](https://www.hackerearth.com/), [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/), etc, which provide various questions on every programming language to practice (I prefer to start the language proficiency section at [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) Platform, where you can practice question on any language).
- After doing a sufficient amount of practice you can move on to the next step, i.e., learning Data Structure and Algorithms. You have to practice them regularly i.e. at least 5 questions a day, which can be done on any platform mentioned in the [Online Platforms](#online-practice-platforms) section (I prefer the site [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) for learning and practice).
- After that, you can move onto some real business, i.e, competitive programming. The competitive programming is not hard if you can write code using data structure and algorithms technique. There are several platforms where can compete online (Refer to [Online Platforms](#online-practice-platforms) section).

#### Note
- If you are learning C++, then it is advisable to learn STL i.e. Standard Template libraries in C++. It provides some inbuilt data struction libraries and functions which helps to write code fast and efficient. You can learn STL from any resource mentioned in various sections.

## Common mistakes and misconceptions during competitive coding
- Never try to copy or steal code from anywhere, the main reason why anyone wants to start competitive programming is to master their coding skills which cannot be done while copying. It's okay to refer somewhere after the ongoing competition is over.
- After starting with competitive programming, most of the coders stop learning and practicing new questions. This is wrong because your practice will never be sufficient, every question faced by will be different from previous ones.
- At the early stage of programming most of us don't make notes thinking everything is available online and you can refer to them at any time. But this is not true, because every question you will face is gonna solve with different approaches and it is better to write those approaches in your notebook, it helps to analyze many methods to solve particular types of questions.
