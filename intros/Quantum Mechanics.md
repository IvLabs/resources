## Quantum Mechanics 

This course is very different from all the other courses mentioned above, for it focuses on delivering a scientifically pure approach towards Quantum Mechanics which can later be manifested and utilized in understanding and working on Quantum Computing. This course covers everything from the very grass-root level of concepts and helps develop a pretty concrete understanding and intuition for almost all aspects of modern physics backed by Quantum Mechanics. It is presented by MIT OCW and the instructor in charge is Dr. Barton Zweibach.
