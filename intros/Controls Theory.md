## Controls Theory

##### An effort to make any system behave the way you want or achieve a goal that you desire.

  [**Classical Control Theory:**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUMWjy5jgHK1NC52DXXrriwihVrYZKqjk)[Brian Douglas Controls Basics](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUMWjy5jgHK3j74Z5Tq6Tso1fSfVWZC8L)

**Why do this course ? :** As we’ve seen whenever we have a system which we want to control, like for example, let’s take a simple pendulum (most basic example), suppose I want the pendulum to go upright and stay there, well how do I achieve that? The most basic approach is using the knowledge from control systems to make it stay upright and be able to handle disturbances like the wind is blowing (very rare for the wind to blow in a laboratory, but just a simple case to understand). We should be able to take this into account for robustness. That’s what this lecture series offers. You will be ready to face the world of controls very nicely once you’ve seen the beauty it upholds.Now the simple pendulum is just a simple case that I’ve given, you can extend this idea to any system, from Snake robots to Humanoids to Drones to what not.	 

**2)** [**Control of Mobile Robots:**](https://www.coursera.org/learn/mobile-robot)

**For whom ?:** Whoever wants to explore the field of [**Control Theory**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBc_BHxw78s), [**Motion or path planning** ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_planning)should surely have a look at this course to get a basic overview. This course will focus more on differential drive robots compared to other dynamical systems.

**What's good about this course ?:** It is fairly different from the general long lectured continuous courses, it maintains a very good balance between theory and its implementation. The concepts are explained really well using some excellent analogies. 

**Course info:** Course focuses on the problem of establishing control over a robot with the pursuit of making it move in a safe and optimal way. The course covers the classic PID control and its applications in controlling a differential drive robot and then moves on to cover the Classical Control Theory which helps span principles and fundamentals applicable for control of almost all types of dynamical systems.
