## IoT

Deals with all manner of conventional devices made smart and connected, so they can be made more convenient to use. Applications can range from increasing convenience, like connecting a light bulb to your phone, so you don’t have to move your lazy ass to switch it on and off, to safety applications to detect and warn users about harmful gases, and the like.

### Course:

[Android Programming Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd801)

This requires knowledge of embedded linux (on Raspberry Pi, and other SBCs), Python (The de-facto language for an RPi), microcontrollers, network Connectivity (Firebase, LAN systems), and App Development. The course mentioned is the Android Development Nanodegree, which will give you a fair base to start developing for android. Apart from this, use linux as your daily driver OS, do as much stuff as you can from a terminal (You will mostly SSH into an RPi, no GUI), and you should be fine.Since IoT projects involve wrangling with a whole host of APIs, SDKs and other stuff, there are no courses that encompass it fully, but an app is almost always part of the loop.

**Example:** The next version of the Sahayak Robot (the hospital one), will be capable of control from a smartphone, with a live video feed, and video chatting with the patients.
