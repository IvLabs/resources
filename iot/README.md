# IoT

IoT deals with all manner of conventional devices made smart and connected, so they can be made more convenient to use. Applications can range from increasing convenience, like connecting a light bulb to your phone, so you donâ€™t have to move to switch it on and off, to safety applications to detect and warn users about harmful gases, and the like.


## Course

[Android Programming Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd801)

This requires knowledge of embedded linux (on Raspberry Pi, and other SBCs), Python (The de-facto language for an RPi), microcontrollers, network Connectivity (Firebase, LAN systems), and App Development. The course mentioned is the Android Development Nanodegree, which will give you a fair base to start developing for android. Apart from this, use linux as your daily driver OS, do as much stuff as you can from a terminal (You will mostly SSH into an RPi, no GUI), and you should be fine.Since IoT projects involve wrangling with a whole host of APIs, SDKs and other stuff, there are no courses that encompass it fully, but an app is almost always part of the loop.

**Example:** The next version of the Sahayak Robot, will be capable of remote control from a smartphone, with a live video feed, and video chatting with the patients.

## Books

[IoT For Architects](https://www.amazon.in/Internet-Things-Architects-communication-infrastructure/dp/1788470591)

This book encompasses the entire spectrum of IoT solutions, from sensors to the cloud. it starts by examining modern sensor systems and focus on their power and functionality. After that,  diving deep into communication theory, paying close attention to near-range PAN, including the new Bluetooth 5.0 specification and mesh networks. Then,  IP-based communication in LAN and WAN, including 802.11ah, 5G LTE cellular, SigFox, and LoRaWAN. Next, it covers edge routing and gateways and their role in fog computing, as well as the messaging protocols of MQTT and CoAP.
