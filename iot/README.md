## IoT

Deals with all manner of conventional devices made smart and connected, so they can be made more convenient to use. Applications can range from increasing convenience, like connecting a light bulb to your phone, so you donâ€™t have to move to switch it on and off, to safety applications to detect and warn users about harmful gases, and the like.

### Course:

[Android Programming Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd801)

This requires knowledge of embedded linux (on Raspberry Pi, and other SBCs), Python (The de-facto language for an RPi), microcontrollers, network Connectivity (Firebase, LAN systems), and App Development. The course mentioned is the Android Development Nanodegree, which will give you a fair base to start developing for android. Apart from this, use linux as your daily driver OS, do as much stuff as you can from a terminal (You will mostly SSH into an RPi, no GUI), and you should be fine.Since IoT projects involve wrangling with a whole host of APIs, SDKs and other stuff, there are no courses that encompass it fully, but an app is almost always part of the loop.

**Example:** The next version of the Sahayak Robot (the hospital one), will be capable of control from a smartphone, with a live video feed, and video chatting with the patients.
