## Guidelines for contributing
1. You are encouraged to add links to the following: 
   * Online courses
   * Books
   * Tutorials/Code Implementations
   * Important Research Papers
   * Other useful things
2. All of these should be segregated by sub-topic.
3. Refer to existing sections before contributing a new one.
4. Follow the Fork-Commit-Pull Request cycle for contributing, more on this [here](https://github.com/IvLabs/pc_guidelines/tree/master/opensource_git_contrib)
5. If you create a new topic folder make sure to **link that folder in landing page `README.md`**
6. The **name of folder should be consistent with exact format of `word1-word2`**. Some NOT allowed forms are `word1 word2`, `word1word2`, `Word1-word2`, etc. This maintains consistency and proper ordering of folder.
7. The topic names in [Topic](#Topics) should be in increasing alphabetical order.
